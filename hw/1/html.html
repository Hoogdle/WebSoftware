                    In her first book, Kristin Cavallari shared her personal journey along with 
                    her tips on everything from style to relationships. 
                    And now, with True Roots, Cavallari shows you that improving the way you 
                    eat doesn't have to be difficult-a clean and toxin- free diet can and should be fun,
                    easy, and enjoyable. She learned the hard way that dieting leads nowhere good, 
                    and that a clean lifestyle is the ticket to feeling and being healthy.

                    Fear is the reason most salespeople don't like to pick up the phone.
